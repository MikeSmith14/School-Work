To run the program, the best practice is to execute the clean makefile first by 
typing "./clean" in the command line. This will remove all executables from the 
project. Next, "./build" needs to be typed into the command line. This executes
a makefile that generates the executables from the code. To convert a TINY BASIC
file to C, the user needs to type "./proja filename" where filename has the
extension .tb. The user can then type "gcc filename" where it has the same
filename as the TINY BASIC file, but has .C extension.

I included a basic "test.tb" file that will perform a simple calculation; then once it is converted into the 
C program it will print out the result of said calculation.

Included screenshots in the file of the compilation and the results of the testing.
